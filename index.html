    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals & Soft Clay -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A task-oriented dashboard design is used over a linear report format to better serve a social media manager's workflow. The structure includes: 1) An interactive 'Architecture of Ambiance' section to quickly teach core principles. 2) A filterable 'Curated Playlist' to allow users to find specific audio vibes on demand. 3) An interactive 'Audio Matrix' for direct comparison. 4) An accordion-style 'Strategist's Toolkit' for actionable advice. This structure prioritizes user interaction and efficient task completion (finding a track, understanding a concept) over passive reading. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: Core principles of luxury audio. -> Goal: Inform & Engage. -> Viz/Presentation: Interactive cards and a Chart.js bar chart for the ideal BPM range. -> Interaction: Click to reveal text. -> Justification: Breaks down complex ideas into digestible, interactive chunks. | Report Info: Curated track list. -> Goal: Organize & Compare. -> Viz/Presentation: Filterable card grid. -> Interaction: Filter by vibe, click for modal with details. -> Justification: Allows users to quickly find relevant tracks for a specific need. | Report Info: Comparison table. -> Goal: Compare. -> Viz/Presentation: Sortable HTML table. -> Interaction: Click table headers to sort. -> Justification: Enhances utility over a static table. | Report Info: Strategic advice. -> Goal: Organize & Inform. -> Viz/Presentation: Accordion component. -> Interaction: Click to expand/collapse. -> Justification: Presents dense information cleanly. All visualizations are built with Chart.js or HTML/CSS, adhering to the NO SVG/Mermaid constraint. -->

                    This section decodes the "luxury aesthetic" sound. Rather than a single genre, it's an atmosphere built from specific sonic elements. Interact with the components below to understand the foundational principles for selecting the perfect audio for your brand.

                        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">The speed of a track is critical. For luxury skincare, a slower tempo (60-90 BPM) mirrors a resting heart rate, creating a calm, contemplative state that allows viewers to appreciate product details.</p>
